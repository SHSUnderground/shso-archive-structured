# SHSO Structured Archive
# Description
This repo is intended to serve as an archive of the cached files downloaded by the original game SHSO when it was up.
It was reorganized to show what the files are supposed to be called and where they were supposed to be stored in a normal Unity build of the game.

# Legal Disclaimer
All of the characters, artwork, and everything are copyrighted and owned by the now defunct Gazillion (software part) and Disney (everything else). I claim absolutely no ownership and this repository is for archival purposes only.
